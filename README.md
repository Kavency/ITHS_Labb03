### Labb03 - GUI

This time we were given the task to build a GUI application using WPF and the MVVM design pattern.

As usual when you are doing something for the first time it's challanging, sometimes frustrating and a lot of fun.

The app is a quiz configurator in wich you can create packs of multichoice quetsions. Questions and answers are randomized during playtime.
It's far from complete but it is a start. ðŸ˜‰
